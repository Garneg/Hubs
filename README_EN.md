# Hubs

Unofficial mobile client for the IT site [Habr](https://habr.com), made to lern Android Jetpack Compose framework and Kotlin (I'm a beginner so don't expect high quality code from me, but over time I will improve the code in this repository)
The goal of this app is to provide full experience of using Habr in a more native way, including, but not limited to, authorization, leaving comments to publications, participating in polls
